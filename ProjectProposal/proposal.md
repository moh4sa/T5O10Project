## Predicting The Sales of a Video Game 
--- 
## Abstract
The goal of the project is to predict the sales value of video game globally based on genera or platform, and how much the video game will be able to generate revenue for the game creators using use regression models. 
### The project trying to answers the following questions:
- > **what're the sales values could my game generate globally based on genera or platform?**
- > **what're Platforms or Publisher with the most sales values?**
- > **what're game with the most sales values globally?**

## Data
Project [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales) contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It was generated by a scrape of [vgchartz](https://vgchartz.com) available in Kaggle. it has 16,598 records and 11 columns.

- JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions)
- Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)
- Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales.

## Tools:
#### TBC later*
- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for modeling
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting

## MVP Goal:
should be able to predict general sales vlues not based on genra or platform
